## How marks were deducted (rules)

- JS comments are ignored, so starter TODO comments do NOT count.
- The grader checks `server.js` and `server/models/song.model.js`.
- `.env` is intentionally excluded from grading.
- `db.js` is intentionally excluded from grading.
- Checks are intentionally lenient and verify top-level implementation only.
- Code can be in ANY order; repeated code is allowed.
- Common equivalents are accepted where possible.
- npm install commands and manual testing commands are NOT graded.
- Missing required items reduce marks proportionally within that TODO.
- The script checks for the required REST API structure, not exact wording.
